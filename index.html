									<h2>Other Projects and Interests</h2>
									<br/>
									<p>Along with a career as an SAP IBP Solution Architect, I have several other interests and aspirations.  This diversification allows my to boost my career by adding more tools to my toolbelt.  These projects include: </p>
										<br/>
										<h3>This Website</h3>
											<li> This website is built using an HTML/CSS/JavaScript Template downloaded from <a href="https://html5up.net/" target="_"> https://html5up.net/ </a>  </li>
											<li> From the template, I made my own edits to the HTML and CSS files to generate content.</li>
											<li> All files are hosted with Github Pages and the Domain is purchased through Google Domains. </li>
										<br/> <br/>
										<h3>Stock Market Analysis</h3>
											<li> With seemingly infinite possibilities of where to invest, I am continously developing an automated tool to analyze and rank different companies based several financial metrics.  This allows me to practice and apply data-driven decision making.
											<li> All analytics, rankings, and visualizations are performed using Python scripting language </li>
										<br/> <br/>
										<h3>Automation of Excel Functionality for SAP IBP</h3>
											<li> One of the main advantages of IBP is the Microsoft Excel Add-In, which allows users to generate and manipulate Reports from a cloud-based database. This is built from SAP as a Microsoft Visual Basic Add-In.</li>
											<li> There are several features that have been common requests from previous clients.  I have taken these requests and begun development on my own Excel Add-In which allows users to further manipulate their IBP data.  </li>
											<li> All scripting is done in Microsft Visual Basic.  </li>
